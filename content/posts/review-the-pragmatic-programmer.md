Today i decided to add my review about one of the best books among the software engineers, its a must to have in your bookshelf.
The book was written by __Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt__ , and the motto of the book was 
## **_YOUR JOURNEY TO MASTERY_**.
This book starts with simple yet profound message 
>ITS YOUR LIFE 

It reminds us of our own __power__ in our __code-base__, __jobs__ , __careers__.
Why this book is different then other books is that it understands what it means to be a programmer.
As a relative newcommer, its easy to be overwhelmed not by the act of programming but the process of 
becoming a programmer.

There is an entire mindset shift that needs to happen -- c changed in the habbits, behaviours, and 
expectations.
The book says that the process of becoming the better programmer does not just happen because
> you know how to code ; It must be met with __intention__ and __delibrate practice__

And believe me this book teach it best.

Just a quick reminder, i will be reviewing thier __20th Edition__ as it the updated edition that came out recently ...
