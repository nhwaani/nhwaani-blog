## Books:

"*The most practical book so far on distributed systems.
It covers everything related large scale concept, together with real-world examples.*"


- [The Beginning of infinity]() by [David Deutsch](https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf)
  > Naval : " Deutsch dramatically expands on that in The Beginning of Infinity.
  > The wide-ranging nature that he covers is incredible. 
  > 
  > He covers epistemology—which is the theory of *knowledge—quantum mechanics*, 
  > *multiverse theory*, *infinity*, *mathematics*,
  > *the reach of what is knowable and what is not knowable*, *universal explanations*, 
  > *the theory of computatio*n, *what is beauty*, *what systems of politics work better*, 
  > how to raise your children, and more. 
  > These are all-encompassing, long-range philosophical ideas.
