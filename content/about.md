Hey, My name is Nadeem Hilal, i am a Backend Software Engineer from a remote area of the world known as **KASHMIR**.

>*I want to do space-walk* , *fly to space and explore sometime there,*
>
> *Insha-Allah.*

I love **Software Engineering** as i feel it helps me express myself:
- Solving complex business problems.
- Creating new solutions.
- Debugging issues.
- Teaching people craft.

I love building and designing system for scale.

I love reading books most of the time, here are some book [recommendations](/archives/2022/02/reading-list/).

I love debuging and solving issues, its highly addictive activity, especially when it make you sleepless,
restless for nights and finally you figure out **why ?**


Most of the time i am busy solidifying my knowledge regarding:

**#Software architecture** **#Scalability**
**#Designing Applications** **#Operating System**
**#Algorithms**  **#Data Structures** **#Code Refactoring**
**#Databases** **#Programming** **System Design**
