Hey, My name is Nadeem Hilal, i am an Software Engineer by chance from a remote area of the world known as **KASHMIR**.
I have completed my masters in Computer Applications aka (M.C.A) from the [University of Kashmir North Campus](http://northcampus.uok.edu.in/).

Currently i am living in **DUBAI** and alhamduliallah earing some bucks by working as a Software engineer. 
I have got in love with the CS (**Software Engineering** field) as i keep exploring it. 

I Find it very interesting , especially the addiction when u hunt for a bug that kept u sleepless from nights.

I want to do space walk and fly to see space and explore sometime there.

    **#Software architecture** **#Scalability** **#Designing Applications** 
    **#Operating System** **#Algorithms**  **#Data Structures** **#Code Refactoring**
    **#Databases** **#Programming**
